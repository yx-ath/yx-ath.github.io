title: Blog Post 2 - Spectral Clustering
---

> In this blog post, I'll write a tutorial on a simple version of the *spectral clustering* algorithm for clustering data points. Each of the below parts are necessary specific tasks for creating the spectral clustering.

## Introduction

This part is the introduction of studying *spectral clustering*. Spectral clustering is an important tool for identifying meaningful parts of data sets with complex structure. To start, let's look at an example where we *don't* need spectral clustering.

Note: This part is referenced from Phil's PIC 16B Blog Post 2 Spectral Clustering introduction part.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
```python
n = 200
np.random.seed(1111)
X, y = datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, random_state=None, centers = 2, cluster_std = 2.0)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```
![BP2_intro_1.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_intro_1.png)

*Clustering* refers to the task of separating this data set into the two natural "blobs." K-means is a very common way to achieve this task, which has good performance on circular-ish blobs like these:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)

plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```
![BP2_intro_2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_intro_2.png)


## Harder Clustering

Note: This part is referenced from Phil's PIC 16B Blog Post 2 Spectral Clustering introduction part.

That was all well and good, but what if our data is "shaped weird"? Here, we can use the function `make_moons` supported by python to make the moonlike clusters:

```python
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 200
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```
![BP2_harder_clustering_1.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_harder_clustering_1.png)

Similar as in *Intro*, can still make out two meaningful clusters in the data, but now they aren't blobs but crescents. As before, the Euclidean coordinates of the data points are contained in the matrix `X`, while the labels of each point are contained in `y`. Now k-means won't work so well, because k-means is, by design, looking for circular clusters. 

```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```
![BP2_harder_clustering_2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_harder_clustering_2.png)

Clearly from the figure above, the clustering went wrong with the k-Means algorithm.

As will suggest below, spectral clustering is able to correctly cluster the two crescents. The following parts shows how to derive and implement spectral clustering.

## Part A: Similarity Matrix Construction

> In this part, construct an <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n \times n"> *similarity matrix* **A**, where n is the number of data points in the created cluster plot

First, clarify and define the similarity matrix needed here:

- The matrix construction should be based on another external parameter `epsilon`. Specifically, for each entry `A[i,j]` of **A**, the value should be equal to one if data point `i` is within the distance `epsilon` of data point `j`, which is to say,

$$A[i, j] = 1 \text{ if } (X[i] - X[j])**2 < epsilon**2$$

- Moreover, the diagonal entries `A[i,i]` should all be equal to zero.

Now let's start constructing the matrix:

For this part, I specified the value `epsilon = 0.4`. Also, to be more convenient for function construction, I used the function `pairwise_distance` from `sklearn.metrics` module, which could compute the euclidean distance between specified data points i and j.

```python
epsilon = 0.4
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
```

To construct the similarity matrix **A**, I construct a function `similarity_matrix_construction`, which inputs the set of data points `X` and the `epsilon` value. Below is the function def.

```python
def similarity_matrix_construction(X, epsilon):
  """
  Construct a similarity matrix indicator for whether each X[i]
  and X[j] are less than epsilon apart. Also, diagonal entries
  should all be zero for the desired output matrix.

  Input
  --------
  X: all data points informations
  epsilon: the maximum distance to be accepted

  Output
  --------
  A: the desired similarity matrix
  """
  # get dimension
  n = X.shape[0]
  # create empty matrix
  A = np.ndarray(shape = (n, n))
  # create matrix of distances using pairwise_distances
  # note: pairwise distances create a matrix D with D_ij as
  # distance between point X[i] and X[j]
  D = pairwise_distances(X, metric = 'euclidean')
  # now try to fill in A with information in D and epsilon
  A[D < epsilon**2] = 1
  A[D >= epsilon**2] = 0
  # empty the diagonal entries
  np.fill_diagonal(A, 0)
  # return similarity matrix
  return A
```

Now, store such similarity matrix as **A** for further use, and visualize the matrix:

```python
A = similarity_matrix_construction(X, epsilon)
A
```
```text
array([[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       ...,
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 1.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 1., 0., 0.]])
```

The matrix **A** now contains information about which points are near (within distance `epsilon`) which other points.

## Part B: Clustering Data Points - Binary Norm Cut Objective of Similarity Matrix

> This part pose the task of clustering the data points in `X` as the task of partitioning the rows and columns of **A**. 

### B.0 Introduce the Concept of Binary Norm Cut Objective

To do spectral clustering, a key point is to find a small binary normcut objective. The *binary norm cut objective* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)"> of a matrix **A** with clusters clusters <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1"> is defined as:

$$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)\equiv \mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)}\right)\;.$$

In this expression, 
- the *cut* term <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)"> of clusters <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1"> is defined as the sum over all entries of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A_{ij}">, which needs to satisfy the conditions that i) the entries' row indices *i* belongs to cluster <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0">, and ii) the column indices *j* belongs to cluster <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1">.
- The volume of a cluster <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{vol}(C_0) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0}d_i$, where $d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}"> is defined as the size of the cluster. 

A pair of clusters <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1"> is considered to be a pair of "good" clstering when <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)"> is small. The below parts would also partially show why having small binary norm cut objective is important by calculation based on real data.


### B.1 The Cut Term

> In this part, I'll write a function called `cut(A,y)` to compute the cut term.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
My suggestion: It would be helpful if you could add more inline explanations inside the codelines to make the codes more clear to readers. @d.y
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

The cut term <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)">, by definition, calculates total number of datapoints pairs <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(i, j)">, such that *i* is in cluster <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and *j* is in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1">, and that they are within *epsilon* distance apart. Having a small value for cut term would means, generally speaking, that clusters <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1"> are distance apart, which means that the clustering is somehow clear with less mismatches and mixings.

Now, write a python function *cut(A, y)* to directly calculate the cut term.

```python
def cut(A, y):
  """
  calculate cut term with sim matrix A and
  the cluster-specifying vector y.

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  cut: the cut term
  """
  # create the two clusters
  C0 = np.where(y == 0)[0]
  C1 = np.where(y == 1)[0]
  # calculate cut sum
  cut = 0
  for i in C0:
    for j in C1:
      cut += A[i, j]
  return cut
```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">

I changed the original for-loop into the version with list comprehension.

Version before change:

```python
def cut(A, y):
  """
  calculate cut term with sim matrix A and
  the cluster-specifying vector y.

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  cut: the cut term
  """
  # create the two clusters
  C0 = np.where(y == 0)[0]
  C1 = np.where(y == 1)[0]
  # calculate cut sum
  cut = 0
  for i in C0:
    for j in C1:
      cut += A[i, j]
  return cut
```

Peer's Feedback: "It's better if you can avoid loops in the function (e.g in the cut() function)."
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

Below is an example calculation of the cut objectives. The true clusters refers `y` created in the cluster creation process, and the random clusters refers a vector named `random`, which has the same objective as `y` except that it is created totally at random. With such definition, we would expect the true cut to be lower than the random cut, as true clustering should work out better than the random clustering (which is supposed to be totally random and thus has bad clusters) selection among all datapoints.

```python
# cut with true cluster y
true_cluster_cut = cut(A, y)
# cut with random cluster vector
np.random.seed(9999)
random = np.random.randint(2, size = A.shape[0])
random_cluster_cut = cut(A, random)
# find the two values with print
print("The cut objective for the true cluster is:", true_cluster_cut)
print("The cut objective for the random cluster is:", random_cluster_cut)
```
```
The cut objective for the true cluster is: 0.0
The cut objective for the random cluster is: 383.0
```

From the result above, as the true cut is 0, which is really nice and much more lower than the random clustering, it shows that this part of the cut objective indeed favors the true clusters over the random ones.

### B.2 The Volume Term 

> In this part, I'll write a function called `vols(A,y)` which computes the volumes of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1">., returning them as a tuple. (for example, `v0, v1 = vols(A,y)`)

As defined in part B.0, the volume of a cluster is simply the size of the cluster. With the definition of similarity matrix, the calculation could simply be done by summing entries over matrix A, which is direct. Below is the function def *vols(A, y)* of calculating the volumes of both cluster <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_0"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1">.

```python
def vols(A,y):
  """
  compute the volume of cluster C0 and C1 of
  the similarity matrix A specified by y

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  (C0_vol, C1_vol): the volumes of clusters C0 and C1
  """
  # create a matrix d to store row sums of A
  d = A.sum(axis = 0)
  # find C0_vol and C1_vol by indexing sums
  C0_vol = d[y == 0].sum()
  C1_vol = d[y == 1].sum()
  # return output
  return (C0_vol, C1_vol)
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">

I changed the original for-loop with list comprehension version into the direct application to the np.sum function, which is suggested from my peer's feedback.

Version before change:

```python
def vols(A,y):
  """
  compute the volume of cluster C0 and C1 of
  the similarity matrix A specified by y

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  (C0_vol, C1_vol): the volumes of clusters C0 and C1
  """
  # create the two clusters
  C0 = np.where(y == 0)[0]
  C1 = np.where(y == 1)[0]
  # calculate volume of C0 and C1
  C0_vol = np.sum([np.sum(A[i, ]) for i in C0])
  C1_vol = np.sum([np.sum(A[j, ]) for j in C1])
  # return volumes
  return (C0_vol, C1_vol)
```

Peer's Feedback: "I believe that you could make your code for the function vols(A,y) more efficient. You could first calculate the d matrix, which contains the sums for each row of the matrix A (you could use np.sum for this). Then, you could use this d to find this sums for cluster C0 and C1 using boolean indexing (something like v0 = d[y==0].sum() ). In this way, you could avoid for loops and increase your efficiency :)."
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

### B.3 The Norm Cut Calculation

> In this part, I'll write a function called `normcut(A,y)`, which uses `cut(A,y)` and `vols(A,y)` to compute the binary normalized cut objective of a matrix **A** with clustering vector `y`. 

Based on equationed definition mentioned in *part B.0*, can calculate the Norm Cut.

Below is the function def of `normcut(A, y)`:

```python
def normcut(A, y):
  """
  calculate the normcut of cluster C0 and C1 of
  the similarity matrix A specified by y

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  normcut: the normcut of clusters C0 and C1
  """
  vol_c0, vol_c1 = vols(A, y)
  normcut = cut(A, y) * (1 / vol_c0 + 1 / vol_c1)
  return normcut
```

### B.4 Norm Cut Comparison

Now, similar as *part B.2*, compare the calculated norm cut objective on both *y* and *random* to conclude that the norm cut objective also favors the true clusters over the random ones, as better clustering is supposed to have a lower normcut objective, similar as the cut objective. 

- Why?: In this way, could see the normcut objective as a weighted version of the cut objective, and thus better normcut should have lower value to show that the two clusters are successfully separated, similarly with the understanding in part B.2).

```python
# cut with true labels y
true_labels_normcut = normcut(A, y)
# cut with fake labels vector
fake_labels_normcut = normcut(A, random)
# find the two values with print
print("The normcut objective for the true cluster is:", true_labels_normcut)
print("The normcut objective for the random cluster is:", fake_labels_normcut)
```
```
The normcut objective for the true cluster is: 0.0
The normcut objective for the random cluster is: 1.0074122463651651
```

From the result, the normcut objective for true cluster is 0, which is way lower than about 1 of the one for random cluster. Therefore, can conclude that the norm cut objective also favors the true clusters over the random ones.

## Part C: Find Small Normcut - The (D, z) Definition of Normcut

> This part helps to prove that the value `y` for making `normcut(A, y)` small can be calculated using a specified equation that could be calculated directly as follows:

$$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1) = 2\frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}}\;,$$


### C.1 Concepts and Process Specification

For success clustering, need to find `y` such that `normcut(A,y)` is small. However, from the definition in part B, it is hard to do minimization and find a small normcut term. This part actually shows that instead of the definition in part B, we can use another definition, as shown as the equation def above, which is a purely linear algebra well-defined equation, such that is direct for the minimization problem.

Below is a set of mathematical definitions of the above term:

1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^n"> is defined as: 

$$
z_i = 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\ 
    -\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 1 \\ 
\end{cases}
$$

2. the matrix *D* is:

the diagonal matrix with nonzero entries <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_{ii} = d_i">, and  where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i"> is the degree (row-sum) from before.

3. Show that the defined equation holds:

$$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1) = 2\frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}}\;,$$


### C.1 Proof with Programming

Now, let's do the computation process, in the following part, I'll:

1. Write a function called `transform(A,y)`: compute the appropriate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}"> vector given **A** and **y**, using the formula above.

```python
def transform(A,y):
  """
  calculate z-vector of cluster C0 and C1 of
  the similarity matrix A specified by y

  Input
  --------
  A: the similarity matrix created
  y: the cluster-specifying vector, 0 or 1 valued entries
  
  Output
  --------
  z: the z-vector of clusters C0 and C1
  """
  z = np.zeros(y.shape[0])
  vol_c0, vol_c1 = vols(A, y)
  z[y == 0] = 1 / vol_c0
  z[y == 1] = -1 / vol_c1
  return z
```

2. Construct the matrix D from A

```python
def D_construction(A):
  """
  calculate the desired diagonal rowsum-valued matrix D from A
  """
  # create vector storing all rowsums of sim matrix A
  A_row_sum = [np.sum(A[i, ]) for i in np.arange(A.shape[0])]
  # construct and return result D
  D = np.diag(A_row_sum)
  return D
```

3. Show that the equation (want to prove) holds

Here the equation above is exact, but computer arithmetic is not! The python function `np.isclose(a,b)` is a good way to check if `a` is "close" to `b`, in the sense that they differ by less than the smallest amount that the computer is (by default) able to quantify.

Below is the total construction process use functions in 1 and 2 as well as checking whether the equation holds (LHS = RHS):

```python
# calculate the diagonal rowsum-valued matrix D
D = D_construction(A)
# calculate z-vector
z = transform(A, y)
# find the right hand side of the equation
normcut_with_D_z = 2 * z@(D-A)@z / (z@D@z)
# check validility and correctness of the equation
# note: normcut(A, y) calculate left hand side of the eqn
np.isclose(normcut(A, y), normcut_with_D_z)
```

## Part D: Minimize Normcut Objective

As shown in last part, the normcut function

$$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1) = 2\frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}}\;,$$


Therefore, find small normcut objective now becomes the mathematical optimization problem of minimizing the function:

$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

subject to the condition <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0">. It's actually possible to bake this condition into the optimization, by substituting for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}"> the orthogonal complement of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}"> relative to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{1}">. Below function `orth_obj` function handles this porblem. 

```python
def orth(u, v):
    return (u @ v) / (v @ v) * v

e = np.ones(n) 

d = D @ e

def orth_obj(z):
    z_o = z - orth(z, d)
    return (z_o @ (D - A) @ z_o)/(z_o @ D @ z_o)
```

Now, use the function `minimize` from `scipy.optimize` module to minimize the function `orth_obj` with respect to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}">.

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

minimized_contents = minimize(orth_obj, z)
minimized_contents.keys()
```
dict_keys(['fun', 'jac', 'hess_inv', 'nfev', 'njev', 'status', 'success', 'message', 'x', 'nit'])

Now, can see that the minimized contents contains a lot of components, the desired data result we want is actually from the content `'x'`. Therefore, store the minimized `z` as `z_min` with the `'x'` key from `minimized_contents`:

```python
z_min = minimized_contents.x
```

## Part E: Scattering Spectral Clusters with Minimized Normcut

From `part d`, get that `z_min` is the clustering that minimize the Normcut. Now, plot the scatter plot by changing coloring to `z_min`:

```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = z_min)
```
![BP2_part_e.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_e.png)

Nice! With the spectral clustering, now the scatters are with the correct clusters based on `z_min`.

## Part F: Implicit Optimization of Orthogonal Objectives

From part d, we actually do the explicit optimization using the function `minimize` supported by python. However, it is way too complicated sometimes when programming. Actually, the minimization problem can be solved using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. Below is an explanation on how things works:

Recall that what we would like to do is minimize the function 

$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

with respect to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}">, subject to the condition <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0">. 

The Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem states that the minimizing <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}"> must be the solution with smallest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem 

$$ (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$

which is equivalent to the standard eigenvalue problem 

$$ \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbb{1} = 0\;.$$

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{1}"> is actually the eigenvector with smallest eigenvalue of the matrix <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})">. 

Therefore, the vector <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{z}"> that we want must be the eigenvector with  the *second*-smallest eigenvalue. 

Based on the above explanation, now we can construct the optimization process in python:

1. Construct the matrix <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})">, which is often called the (normalized) *Laplacian* matrix of the similarity matrix <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{A}">.

To construct the Laplacian matrix, I wrote a function names `L_construction`, which input a matrix A and output its Laplacian matrix. Below is the function def:

```python
def L_construction(A):
  """
  Construct a similarity matrix indicator for whether each X[i]
  and X[j] are less than epsilon apart. Also, diagonal entries
  should all be zero for the desired output matrix.

  Input
  --------
  X: all data points informations
  epsilon: the maximum distance to be accepted

  Output
  --------
  A: the desired similarity matrix
  """
  # create vector storing all rowsums of sim matrix A
  A_row_sum = [np.sum(A[i, ]) for i in np.arange(A.shape[0])]
  # create the diagonal rowsum-valued matrix D
  D = np.diag(A_row_sum)
  # calculate L
  L = np.linalg.inv(D)@(D - A)
  return L
```


2. Find the eigenvector corresponding to its second-smallest eigenvalue, and call it `z_eig`.

First, I wrote a function for finding the second smallest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector. The function `second_smallest_eigen` inputs the desired Laplacian matrix, and outputs the second smallest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector as a tuple. Below is the function construction:

```python
def second_smallest_eigen(L):
  """
  return second smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector
  """
  # Lam gives the eigenvalues of L, U gives the eigenvectors (as columns)
  Lam, U = np.linalg.eig(L)

  # eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue
  # spoiler, you're going to need this one soon!
  ix = Lam.argsort()
  Lam, U = Lam[ix], U[:,ix]

  # 2nd smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector
  return (Lam[1], U[:,1])
```

Now, with the above function as well as the `L_construction` function in 1, can calculate the optimized `z` based on this second smallest eigenvector, name it as `z_eig`. Below is the construction process of `z_eig`.

```python
# calculate L
L = L_construction(A)
# calculate 2nd smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector
Lam[1], U[:,1] = second_smallest_eigen(L)
# store the 2nd smallest-eigenvalued eigenvector as z_eig
z_eig = U[:,1]
```

3. Plot the data again, using the sign of `z_eig` as the color.

Now, with `z_eig`, can do the plotting process similar as *part e*:

```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = z_eig)
```

And again, the scattering is correct!

## Part G: Spectral Clustering

> This part writes a function `spectral_clustering(X, epsilon)`, which basically do the whole spectral clustering process, which is a previous process based summary.

The function `spectral_clustering(X, epsilon)` inputs the data points information `X` and the given distance threshold `epsilon`, and outputs the spectral clustering labeling vector `labels`.

Below is the definition of this function:

```python
def spectral_clustering(X, epsilon):
  """
  Performs spectral clustering based on input data X 
  and the distance threshold epsilon, returning 
  an array of binary labels indicating whether
  data point i is in group 0 or group 1.

  The process is concatenated as four steps:
  1. Construct the similarity matrix.
  2. Construct the Laplacian matrix.
  3. Compute the eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix.
  4. Return labels based on this eigenvector.

  Input
  --------
  X: all data points informations
  epsilon: the maximum distance to be accepted

  Output
  --------
  labels: array of binary labels indicating whether data point i is in group 0 or 1
  """

  # Step 1: Construct the similarity matrix.
  A = similarity_matrix_construction(X, epsilon)
  # Step 2: Construct the Laplacian matrix.
  L = L_construction(A)
  # Step 3: Compute the eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue of L
  sec_small_eigvalue, sec_small_eigvec = second_smallest_eigen(L)
  # Step 4: Return labels based on this eigenvector.
  labels = sec_small_eigvec
  labels[sec_small_eigvec >= 0] = 1
  labels[sec_small_eigvec < 0] = 0
  return labels
```

Now, try to visualize the result labels to make sure the function works, recall that `epsilon = 0.4` is already defined:

```python
spectral_clustering(X, epsilon)
```

```text
array([1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.,
       0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1.,
       1., 1., 0., 1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0.,
       0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.,
       0., 1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1.,
       1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1.,
       1., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.,
       1., 1., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1.,
       1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.,
       1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.,
       1., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0.,
       1., 1., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.])
```

Seems that the function works properly! Now we can work on the graph visualizations to see whether clustering are correctly defined.

## Part H: Mooned Clustering with Different Noise

> This part plots some mooned clustering plots based on different noise levels. To specify, this part fixes number of samples to 1000, and fix `epsilon` to 0.5

With the spectral_clustering function defined, can plot mooned clusters based on spectral clustering with different noise.

First, write a function to do the whole plotting process, with different inputted noise. Below is the function def:

```python
np.random.seed(9999) # set random seed
def plot_scatter_with_noise(noise):
  """
  plot based on different input noises
  """
  X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=1000, shuffle=True, noise=noise, random_state=None)
  labels = spectral_clustering(X, epsilon = 0.5)
  plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = labels)
```

Now, plot with different noises:

1. Noise Level = 0.05

```python
plot_scatter_with_noise(0.05)
```
![BP2_part_h_0.05.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_h_0.05.png)

2. Noise Level = 0.10

```python
plot_scatter_with_noise(0.1)
```
![BP2_part_h_0.1.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_h_0.1.png)

3. Noise Level = 0.15

```python
plot_scatter_with_noise(0.15)
```
![BP2_part_h_0.15.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_h_0.15.png)

4. Noise Level = 0.20

```python
plot_scatter_with_noise(0.2)
```
![BP2_part_h_0.2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_h_0.2.png)

As can see from the above plots, as the noise increases, the "diameter" of the moon increases, and the two moons are more likely to mix between each other. In other words, as noise increases, the general distances between two clusters are decreasing, making the clustering process harder (need lower epsilons).

<div class="gave-help">
My suggestion: It seemed that your plotting organization is nice, but it is somehow hard to show that the noise difference would result in a significant accuracy difference, as the first few plots are also somehow mixed with clustering, while the separation of clusters are clear to be separated. Maybe check on the function def before or try more noise? @d.y

## Part I: More Confirmation in Correctness - Clustering the Bull's Eye

Now let's see that the clustering process works on the bull's eye.

The bull's eye clusters is created and visualized as follows:

```python
n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None, factor = 0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```
![BP2_part_i_circle.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_i_circle.png)

With comparison, first do the clusterning based on the K-Means method:

```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```
![BP2_part_i_km.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_i_km.png)

Clearly can see, the k-means methods does not correctly clustering the bull's eye.

Now let's try with spectral clustering method, with `epsilon = 0.6`:

```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, epsilon = 0.6))
```
![BP2_part_i_sc.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP2_part_i_sc.png)

Yes! Our spectral clustering algorithm correctly clusters the bull's eyes
