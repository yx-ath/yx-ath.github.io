title: Blog Post 2: Spectral Clustering
---

> In this blog post, I'll write a tutorial on a simple version of the *spectral clustering* algorithm for clustering data points. Each of the below parts are necessary specific tasks for creating the spectral clustering.

### Notation

Before starting doing some linear algebra in python, here are some specified notations used in this blog post:

- Boldface capital letters like $\mathbf{A}$ refer to matrices (2d arrays of numbers). 
- Boldface lowercase letters like $\mathbf{v}$ refer to vectors (1d arrays of numbers). 
- $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$ refers to a matrix-matrix product (`A@B`). $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}$ refers to a matrix-vector product (`A@v`).

### Comments and Docstrings

You should plan to comment all of your code. Docstrings are not required except in Part G. 

## Introduction

In this problem, we'll study *spectral clustering*. Spectral clustering is an important tool for identifying meaningful parts of data sets with complex structure. To start, let's look at an example where we *don't* need spectral clustering.
