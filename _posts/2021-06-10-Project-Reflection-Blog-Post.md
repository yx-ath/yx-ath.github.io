> In this blog post, I'll write a reflection on the [class project](https://github.com/guanzhangszhao/YoungNRich) I've done with team *YongNRich*.

## Project Introduction Link

The project works intend to create optimized portfolio with high returns that could be considered as an reference to common investors. Here is the link to the project: [Portfolio Optimization with Stock Volatility](https://github.com/guanzhangszhao/YoungNRich)

## Project Reflection

1. Project Achievements

-  Based on the Fama-French three factor Model, we analyzed and predict the stock performance, retrieving alpha signal, and find the potentially nice combinations of resource (compared to the other combinations from the resources we have) that retrieves stock volatility with a low mean squared error, performed a test on the short-term stock market

- Doing a web scrape from tweets, reddits, as well as tipranks is the sub-effect created by this project. Could be further used and written as a package for user's further usage.

- Retrieve stocks from Yahoo Finance datasets

- Apply tensorflow neural network models as sentiment analysis to predict stock volatility and therefore further predicts stock returns

- Combining predicted returns and alpha signals, finally constructed optimized portfolio as expected.

2. How the Project is Exciting (Prouds)

- By testing on different methods, we actually reduced the mse to a level that we are expected to see, which is a nice prediction method in our project for constructing optimized portfolio with returns. Using twitter as stock volatility predictions let us generally predicts daily patterns from historical webpages, and is thus a highlight point in our project.

- By testing a lot with different methods, we are able to find the best match for predicting stock returns.

3. Potential Improvements

- Higher Computing Power: due to the limitation of computing power in our project. We only choose to include 20,000 characters from daily retrieved twitter, otherwise it is really hard for the project running process. Therefore, the predictions won't be that accurate as expected. We expect the accuracy to be better with a higher computing power.
- Public Information Restriction of Market: due to the limitation of resource
