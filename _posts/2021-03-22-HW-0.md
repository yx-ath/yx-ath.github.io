> Write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data set. 

- First, readin the palmer penguins dataset through the url:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

- Now, visualize the first few entries of the palmer penguins dataset:

```python
penguins.head()
```


```python

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
I learned something really cool from my peer feedback! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
